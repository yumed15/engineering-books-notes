# The Obstacle is the Way

> What stands in the way becomes the way.

> Focus on the things you can control, let go of everything else and turn every new obstacle into an opportunity to get better, stronger, and tougher.

Obstacles are just stepping stones that you need to overcome to reach your goal. They can be physical (e.g. size or ability), mental (e.g. knowledge or experience), or emotional (e.g. fear or frustration). Obstacles can also be real or perceived. Successful organizations and individuals manage to turn adversity into strength and opportunities.

> “The impediment to action advances action. What stands in the way becomes the way.” — Marcus Aurelius

Ryan Holiday centralizes his analysis of ancient philosophers’ works on Stoicism into practical insights and tips to overcome obstacles. These are broken down into 3 disciplines:

* **Perception**: how you look at your problems;

Your perception is how you interpret what’s happening around you. It affects how you see and respond to a situation. To turn adversity to strength, the first step is to manage your perceptions: calmly and objectively evaluate what’s happening, look for opportunities, and actions within your control.

* Be objectiveAcknowledge your PowerControl your NervesDo not panicModify your PerspectiveFocus on What You Can DoFocus on the NowThink Outside the Box; Look for the Opportunity in the Problem
* **Action**: how to tackle problems in actionable parts;

Once you have your perceptions and emotions under control, you’re ready to take real action. No matter how bad your situation, you can always choose to make the most of it. In the end, an obstacle will only be as big as you it make it out to be. Stop procrastinating or avoiding your problems. Take concrete actions to confront them.

* Stay in MotionPersist till you find a SolutionFail ForwardTake One Step at a TimeDo Every Job WellGo for the “Right” Approach (i.e. What Works)Choose Strategy over Brute ForceLet Obstacles Eliminate ThemselvesPut your Frustration to Work; andUse Adversity to your Advantage
* **Will**: how to cultivate and maintain your inner being to conquer problems and difficulties.

Even with Perception and Action, you will still encounter unexpected trials in life. To endure and prevail, you must cultivate the will (or inner power) to confront obstacles over and over again. It’s about knowing that you can/will fail, yet taking the right, consistent actions regardless.

* Use Good Times to Prepare for Bad TimesPlan for your FailuresAccept your ProblemsLove Everything, including your ObstaclesPersevere Till the EndFocus on Helping OthersContemplate Death; andEmbrace the Cycle of Life
