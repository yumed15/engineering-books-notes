# The 10x Rule: The Only Difference Between Success and Failure

It takes you at least 10 times more action and thinking to move beyond your current level of success. Many people set lofty goals but underestimate the amount of action or mindset shift required to achieve that success. Some people take the right massive actions, but still, find themselves underperforming. This could be because they didn’t have the right mindset shift.

The 10X rule strongly emphasizes 10X goals. At best, **you’re only as successful as the goals you set. Both aspects of the rule work hand in hand.** You need to have lofty, extraordinary goals, and you must put in the right amount of effort to make them a reality.

Don’t be afraid to think big, because when you begin limiting the amount of success you desire, you start to cut down on the amount of action needed, and this will make success far from you.

> Success is the progressive actualization of a worthy goal.

**Success = achieve goal + maintain results + repeat.** If you only achieve, but never maintain the results, much less repeat them in greater measures, then you can’t be considered successful. True success is maintained and never ends. After fulfilling one target, you move onto the next with an even greater mindset and action.

> The 10X mindset doesn’t blame people or circumstances for the result it sees, rather, it takes full responsibility for all that happens.

Cultivate the habit of taking responsibility for the outcome of your life. It becomes difficult to take responsibility for a situation you don’t have control over but a 10X performer will think differently by investigating the problem, determining what could have been done differently and take better action next time when a similar situation arises.

> You can change the quality of your life but changing your actions.

The author considers 4 types of action categories:

* **no action** — people in this group have given up on their dreams. They spend time explaining to everyone who listens to them why things aren’t working for them. They are devoted to things that won’t matter in the long run.
* **retreat** — people who have take action at some point but the results weren’t the ones expected. They retreat because of the sense of failure.
* **normal action** — constitutes the majority of the society. Most socially acceptable. People in this category take action but never aims to be extraordinary. Want a normal life, happy with being average, scared of falling below average but never longing for the above-average life.Normal levels of actions can lead to a dangerous life as anything can happen. You can get laid off being easily replaceable or you can go broke if the economy begins to shake.
* **massive action** — considered borderline insanity by many people. It is all about relentlessly engaging in activities that move you forward. Will attract criticism from mediocre people.

> To maximize your potential you need to set high goals.

This doesn’t make you unrealistic. The extraordinary person doesn’t see those goals as unrealistic but only as goals that require massive amount of action compared to others. You should cultivate the habit of reviewing your goals daily which will help you stay on course and be committed.

> The 10X rule is about thinking and acting 10X more than the average person.

Refuse to think and act small. Not happy with your life? Pick up a pen and paper and write your dream life. Don’t think how you’ll get there, just think of the life you want to live. Repeat the process daily but each time come up with 10X strategies and action to get there.
