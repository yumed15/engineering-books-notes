# Creativity, Inc.: Overcoming the Unseen Forces That Stand in the Way of True Inspiration

**Autonomy**

* “I believe that the best managers <mark style="background-color:yellow;">acknowledge and make room for what they do not know</mark>-not just because humility is a virtue but because until one adopts that mindset, the most striking breakthroughs cannot occur. I believe that managers <mark style="background-color:yellow;">must loosen the controls, not tighten them</mark>. They <mark style="background-color:yellow;">must accept risk,</mark> they <mark style="background-color:yellow;">must trust the people they work with</mark> and <mark style="background-color:yellow;">try to clear the path for them</mark>; and always, <mark style="background-color:yellow;">must pay attention to and engage with anything that creates fear.</mark>”
* “What is the point of hiring smart people, we asked, if you <mark style="background-color:yellow;">don’t empower</mark> them to fix what’s broken?”
* “We want people to feel like they can take steps to solve problems without asking permission.”

**Radical Candid feedback** - “I truly believed that <mark style="background-color:yellow;">self-assessment and constructive criticism</mark> had to occur at all levels of a company, and I had tried my best to walk that talk”

**Accountability**

* “The <mark style="background-color:yellow;">responsibility for finding and fixing problems</mark> should be assigned to every employee, from the most senior manager to the lowliest person on the production line.”
* “What makes Pixar special is that <mark style="background-color:yellow;">we acknowledge we will always have problems</mark>, many of them hidden from our view; that we work hard to uncover these problems, even if doing so means making ourselves uncomfortable; and that, when we come across a problem, we marshal all of our energies to solve it. This, more than any elaborate party or turreted workstation, is why I love coming to work in the morning. It is what motivates me and gives me a definite sense of mission.”

**Transparency** - “Don’t wait for things to be perfect before you share them with others. <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Show early and show often</mark>. It’ll be pretty when we get there, but it won’t be pretty along the way.”

**Company culture** - “Getting the <mark style="background-color:yellow;">right people and the right chemistry</mark> is more important than getting the right idea.”
