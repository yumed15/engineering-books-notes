# Anything you want

selling records ⇒ (distributors had an awful system) ⇒ made a selling website - CD Baby ⇒ scaled to 50 friends

be focused on making the service better for customer and not on scaling up

* little things make all the difference
* the silly email - private CD baby jet
* the email from field - From: CD Baby loves Susan
* add the human touch
  * Even if you want to be big someday, remember that you never need to act like a big boring company. Over ten years, it seemed like every time someone raved about how much he loved CD Baby, it was because of one of these little fun human touches.
