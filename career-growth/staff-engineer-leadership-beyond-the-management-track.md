# Staff Engineer: leadership beyond the management track

> _Being a Staff-engineer is not just a role. It’s the intersection of the role, your behaviors, your impact, and the organization’s recognition of all those things._

#### Staff Engineer archetypes

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**The Tech Lead**</mark>** ** guides the approach and execution of a particular team. They partner closely with a single manager, but sometimes they partner with two or three managers within a focused area.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**The Architect**</mark>** ** is responsible for the direction, quality, and approach within a critical area
  * they combine in-depth knowledge of technical constraints, user needs, and organization level leadership.
  * architects are responsible for the success of a specific technical domain within their company, for example, the company’s API design, frontend stack, storage strategy, or cloud infrastructure. For a domain to merit an Architect, it must be both complex and enduringly central to the company’s success.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**The Solver**</mark>** ** digs deep into arbitrarily complex problems and finds an appropriate path forward. Some focus on a given area for long periods. Others bounce from hotspot to hotspot as guided by organizational leadership.
  * The Solver is a trusted agent of the organization who goes deep into knotty problems, continuing to work on them until they’re resolved. Folks in this role are moved onto problems identified by organizational leadership as critical and either lacking a clear approach or with a high degree of execution risk.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**The Right Hand**</mark>** ** extends an executive’s attention, borrowing their scope and authority to operate particularly complex organizations. They provide additional leadership bandwidth to leaders of large-scale organizations.
  * Folks in this role attend their leader’s staff meetings and work to scale that leader’s impact by removing important problems from their plate. Problems addressed at this level are never purely technical and instead involve the intersection of the business, technology, people, culture, and process.

#### Responsibilities

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**setting and editing technical direction**</mark>** **&#x20;
  * write an engineering strategy to guide your organization’s approach to supporting your company’s business objectives with its architecture, technology selection, and organizational structure.
  * curate technical quality to maintain the quality of your company’s architecture and software as it grows and tacks over time.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**providing sponsorship and mentorship**</mark>
  * create space for others so that your team grows stronger than your contribution.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**injecting engineering context into organizational decisions, exploration**</mark>
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**being glue**</mark>** ** (as Tanya Reilly calls it)
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**impact/energy**</mark> - work on what matters to make the most of the working hours you have, particularly as you get further along in your career and life’s commitments expand.&#x20;

> I’ve taken to using the word “energized” over “impactful.” “Impactful” feels company-centric, and while that’s important, “energized” is more inwards-looking. Finding energizing work is what has kept me at Stripe for so long, pursuing impactful work. - Michelle Bu

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**alignment with leadership**</mark> - stay aligned with authority to remain an effective leader over time.
  * Technical leadership roles rely on proxied authority from another (usually, managerial) leader, and continued access to that authority depends on staying aligned, trustworthy, and predictable. To lead, you have to follow. Having a vivid sense of how things ought to work is a powerful leadership tool, but it’s also essential to learn to blend your vision with the visions from your peers and leadership.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**collaboration**</mark> - stop spending your social capital repairing relationships frayed by conflict, and learn to collaborate with folks with different priorities and perspectives.
  * build a network of peers to vet difficult decisions and to give you honest feedback when your role’s authority starts to temper feedback.

#### What to work on

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**impact work valued by the org**</mark> - explore whether your company is experiencing an <mark style="color:yellow;">**existential risk**</mark>** ** - Companies operate in an eternal iterative elimination tournament, balancing future success against surviving until that future becomes the present. If you’re about to lose one of those rounds, then always focus there. Running out of money, like my experience at Digg, can be the most obvious issue, but not every existential issue is financial, like Twitter’s fail whale stability challenges or adapting to the shifts caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**impact work not valued by the org**</mark> - Sometimes you’ll find work that’s worthy of attention but which an organization is incapable of paying attention to, usually because its leadership doesn’t value that work. In some companies, this is <mark style="color:yellow;">**developer tooling work**</mark>. In others, it’s <mark style="color:yellow;">**inclusion work**</mark>. In most companies, it’s <mark style="color:yellow;">**glue work**</mark>.
  * Teaching a company to value something it doesn’t care about is the hardest sort of work you can do, and it often fails, so you should do as little of it as you can, but no less.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**team growth**</mark>** ** - One area that’s often underinvested in (e.g., lots of room to work in) while also being highly leveraged is <mark style="color:yellow;">**growing the team around you**</mark>. Hiring has a lot of folks involved in it, usually in terms of optimizing the hiring funnel, but onboarding, mentoring, and coaching are wholly neglected at many companies despite being at least as impactful as hiring to your company’s engineering velocity.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**getting work finished/unblocking**</mark> - A surprising number of projects are one small change away from succeeding, one quick modification away from unlocking a new opportunity, or one conversation away from consensus. I think of making those <mark style="color:yellow;">**small changes, quick modifications, and short conversations as editing your team’s approach**</mark>.
  * One special sort of editing is helping finish a project that just can’t quite close itself out. Often you’ll have a talented engineer earlier in their career who is already doing the work but can’t quite create buy-in or figure out how to rescope their project into finishable work. It’s surprisingly common that coaching a teammate on how to tweak a project into something finishable and then lending them your privilege to budge the right friction points will transform a six-month slog into a two-week sprint with almost an identical impact.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**manage technical quality**</mark>
  * fix the hot spots that are causing immediate problems&#x20;
  * adopt best practices that are known to improve quality&#x20;
  * prioritize leverage points that preserve quality as your software changes&#x20;
  * align technical vectors in how your organization changes software&#x20;
  * measure technical quality to guide deeper investment&#x20;
  * spin up a technical quality team to create systems and tools for quality&#x20;
  * run a quality program to measure, track and create accountability

{% hint style="warning" %}
* measure the problem at hand, identify where the bulk of the issue occurs, and focus on precisely that area.
* limit yourself to a single best practice rollout at any given time.
{% endhint %}

* quality leverage points, and the three most impactful points are interfaces, stateful systems, and data models.

#### What to avoid

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**snacking**</mark>
  * Hunter Walk recommends that folks avoid “snacking” when they prioritize work. If you’re in a well-run organization, at some point, you’re going to run out of things that are both high-impact and easy. This leaves you with a choice between shifting right to hard and high-impact or shifting down to easy and low-impact. The latter choice–easy and low-impact–is what Walk refers to as snacking.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**preening**</mark>
  * Preening is doing low-impact, high-visibility work. Many companies conflate high-visibility and high-impact so strongly that they can’t distinguish between preening and impact, which is why it’s not uncommon to see some companies’ senior-most engineers spend the majority of their time doing work that’s of dubious value, but that is frequently recognized in company meetings.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**chasing ghosts**</mark>** ** - not being aligned with what the company values&#x20;
  * Dig into what a company values and ensure it aligns with your intended personal growth. If a company’s leadership consists entirely of folks who focus their energy on performative urgency or acts of fealty, don’t be surprised when your success in the company depends on those activities.
  * It’s surprisingly common for a new senior leader to join a company and immediately drive a strategy shift that fundamentally misunderstands the challenges at hand. The ghosts of their previous situation hold such a firm grasp on their understanding of the new company that they misjudge the familiar as the essential.

#### Writing an engineering vision/strategy

To write an engineering vision, write <mark style="color:yellow;">**five engineering strategies**</mark>, and forecast their implications two years into the future.&#x20;

* Take five of your recent strategies, extrapolate how their tradeoffs will play out over the next two to three years. As you edit through the contradictions and weave the threads together, you’ve written an engineering vision.
* The final version will give you what Tanya Reilly calls a robust belief in the future, which makes it easier to understand how your existing strategies relate to each other and simplifies writing new strategies that stand the test of time.
* For a useful vision, a few things to focus on are:&#x20;
  *   <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Write two to three years out**</mark>** ** - Companies, organizations, and technology all change quickly enough that thinking too far into the future is fraught. It also doesn’t work if you

      write a vision that expires in six months–how many strategies would you realistically write within that six- month window? Try to focus on two to three years out; you can expand that horizon a bit if you’re a fairly established company.&#x20;
  * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Ground in your business and your users**</mark>** ** - Effective visions ground themselves in serving your users and your business. That tight connection keeps the vision aligned with your leadership team’s core values–users and business. Bad visions treat technical sophistication as a self-justifying raison d’être–a view that is never shared by your company’s leadership.
  * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Be optimistic rather than audacious**</mark> - Visions should be ambitious, but they shouldn’t be audacious. They should be possible, but the best possible version if possible. Do write what you could accomplish if every project is finished on time and without major setbacks. Don’t write what you think would be possible with infinite resources.&#x20;
  * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Stay concrete and specific**</mark> - Visions get more useful as they get more specific. Generic statements are easy to agree with but don’t help reconcile conflicting strategies. Be a bit more detailed than you’re comfortable with. Details in visions are often illustrative rather than declarative, giving a taste of the future’s flavor rather than offering a binding commitment.&#x20;
  * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Keep it one to two pages long**</mark>** ** - The reality is that most people don’t read long documents. If you write something five or six pages long, readers will start dropping off without finishing it (or will skim it very rapidly without engaging with the details). Force yourself to write something compact, and reference extra context by linking to other documents for the subset of folks who want the full details.

To write an engineering strategy, write <mark style="color:yellow;">**five design documents**</mark>, and pull the similarities out.

* Good strategies guide tradeoffs and explain the rationale behind that guidance. Bad strategies state a policy without explanation, which decouples them from the context they were made.

* _“When should we write design documents?”_ is a strategy worth writing. _“Which databases do we use for which use cases?”_ is a strategy worth writing. _“How should we stage our migration from monolith to services?”_ is worth writing, too.

How

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Start where you are**</mark>** ** - it’s easy to be paralyzed by the inherently vast ambiguity we work in, but you’ve just got to dive in and start writing.&#x20;
  * Waiting for missing information doesn’t work: every missing document is missing for a good reason. Whatever you write will need to change, and if you write something particularly bad, you’ll quickly realize the need to change it. Where you are now is always the best place to start.&#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Write the specifics**</mark>** ** - write until you start to generalize, and then stop writing.
  * If you can’t be specific, wait until you’ve written more design documents. Specific statements create alignment; generic statements create the illusion of alignment.&#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Be opinionated**</mark> - good strategies are opinionated.&#x20;
  * If they aren’t opinionated, then they won’t provide any clarity on decision making. However, being opinionated on its own isn’t enough. You also need to show your work. Show your work. You must show the rationale behind your opinions. Showing your work builds confidence in the first version of a document, but even more importantly, by showing your work, you make it possible for others to modify and extend your work as the underlying context shifts.

#### Writing a design document

> _Design documents have what bad strategies lack: detailed specifics grounded in reality._

When

* for any project whose capabilities will be used by numerous future projects.
* for projects that meaningfully impact your users.
* or any work taking more than a month of engineering time.

How

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Start from the problem**</mark>
  * The clearer the problem statement, the more obvious the solutions.
  * If solutions aren’t obvious, spend more time clarifying the problem.&#x20;
  * If you’re stuck articulating the problem, show what you have to five people and ask them what’s missing: fresh eyes always see the truth.&#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Keep the template simple**</mark>
  * Most companies have a design document template, which is a great pattern to follow. However, those templates are often expanded to serve too many goals.&#x20;
  * Overloaded templates discourage folks from writing design documents in the first place.
  * Prefer minimal design document templates that allow authors to select the most useful sections and only insist on exhaustive details for the riskiest projects.&#x20;
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Gather and review together, write alone**</mark>
  * It’s very unlikely that you personally have all the relevant context to write the best design document on a given topic.&#x20;
  * Before getting far into the process, collect input from folks with relevant perspectives, particularly those who will rely on the output of your design document. However, be skeptical of carrying that collaborative.
  * Look for controversial decisions that came up in multiple designs, particularly those that were hard to agree on.
