### Responsibilities

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Seeing the big picture**</mark> and <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**to avoid local maxima**</mark> - Good decisions need <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**context**</mark>.

### The three maps

* Locator map
  * your place in the wider organization.
  * helps to not be biased towards your team's projects.
  * helps you to make sure the teams you work with really understand their purpose in the organization, who their customers are, and how their work affects other people.
* Topographical map
  * helps navigating the terrain.
  * helps to highlight the friction and gaps between teams and open up the paths of communication.
  * includes understanding your organization's "personality" and how your leaders prefer to work, clarifying how decisions are made.
* Treasure map
  * shows where you're going and lays out some of the stops on the journey.
  * helps you to make sure everyone knows exactly what they're trying to achieve and why.
