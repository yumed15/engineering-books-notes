# The Staff Engineer's Path

### Responsibilities

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Seeing the big picture**</mark> and <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**to avoid local maxima**</mark> - Good decisions need <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**context**</mark>. The <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**local maximum**</mark>, the best decision for a single group, might not be anything like the best decision when you take a broader view.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Ownership for the whole system**</mark> - to avoid the teams’ local maxima
* Have <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**enough perspective**</mark> to track down issues
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Sell the vision**</mark> to the rest of the company - explain what the work will make possible and how the new project affects everyone
* Not a manager, but a <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**leader**</mark>
  * As you increase in seniority, you’ll take on bigger projects, projects that can’t succeed without <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**collaboration, communication and alignment**</mark>; your brilliant solutions will only cause you frustration if you can’t <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**convince**</mark> other people on the team that yours is the right path.
  * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Teaching**</mark> is a form of leadership.
  * Quietly <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**raising everyone’s game**</mark> is leadership.
  * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Setting technical direction**</mark> is leadership.
* You aim to be <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**autonomous**</mark>.
  * Creating a <mark style="background-color:yellow;">backlog of high-impact work</mark>.
* Understand your organization -> by [understanding the culture](page-1.md#understanding-the-culture)

> _Engineers sometimes dismiss organizational skills as "politics", but these skills are part of good engineering: considering the humans who are part of the system, being clear about the problem you're solving, understanding long term consequences, and making trade offs about priorities. If you don't know how to navigate your organization, every change will be much more difficult._

### **The archetypes**

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Tech leads**</mark> - partner with managers to guide the execution of one or more teams.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Architects**</mark> - responsible for the technical direction and quality across a critical area.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Solvers**</mark> - wade into one difficult problem at a time.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Right hands**</mark> - add leadership bandwidth to an organisation.



### The three maps

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Locator map</mark>
  * your place in the wider organization.
  * helps to not be biased towards your team's projects.
  * helps you to make sure the teams you work with really understand their purpose in the organization, who their customers are, and how their work affects other people.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Topographical map</mark>
  * helps navigating the terrain.
  * helps to highlight the friction and gaps between teams and open up the paths of communication.
  * includes understanding your organization's "personality" and how your leaders prefer to work, clarifying how decisions are made.
* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Treasure map</mark>
  * shows where you're going and lays out some of the stops on the journey.
  * helps you to make sure everyone knows exactly what they're trying to achieve and why.

#### Understanding the culture

Westrum classified organizations and their influence on information flows using three categories:

| Pathological                                                                               | Bureaucratic                                                                                        | Generative                                                                                |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| = low-cooperation culture where power and status are the goal and people hoard information | = a rule-oriented culture where information moves through standard channels and change is difficult | = a mission-oriented, high-trust, high-cooperation culture where information flows freely |

#### Points of interest on the map

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Chasms**</mark> = canyons that can form between teams; group cultures, norms, goals, and expectations evolve differently, causing gaps that make it difficult to communicate, make decisions, and resolve disputes.

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Fortresses**</mark> = teams or individuals who seem determined to stop anyone from getting projects done. e.g. the gatekeeprs (well intentioned to keep quality of code and architecture) winning by making proving you mitigated all risks, did capcity estimations etc.

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Disputed territory**</mark> = systems owned by multiple teams - scattered ownership, people owning parts of its behaviour.

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Uncrossable deserts**</mark> = running into a battle that is considered unwinnable (e.g. project that is too big or politically messy)

<mark style="background-color:yellow;">**Paved roads, shortcuts, and long ways around**</mark> = company processes to ensure that the official ways to do something are also the easiest ways. (e.g. self-service checklist to make sure a new component is safe)
